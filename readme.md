This is a simple HTTP server written in Java that can handle basic HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The server is designed to be easily extensible and provides a foundation for building more complex applications.

## Features

  - **GET**: Retrieve information.
  - **POST**: Submit data.
  - **PUT**: Update data.
  - **DELETE**: Delete data.
- Basic routing for specific endpoints:
  - `/` - Home Page
  - `/about` - About Page
  - `/submit` - Handles form submissions (POST request)
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed).

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
- A terminal/command line interface to run the server.
